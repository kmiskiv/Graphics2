// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare uniform variable for MVP matrix; see demo code for hint
//	2) correctly transform input position by MVP matrix

layout (location = 0) in vec4 aPosition;

uniform mat4 uMVP; 
//the correct declaration, do not need a layout/location
//for 4.3 and up: layout (location = 0) uniform mat4 uMVP
//all categories of data use different memory spaces 
//ie an attribute versus an uniform use different memory spaces 
//similar to doing offsets in assembly programming 
//attributes are measured in 4 float slots
//read the console!



void main()
{

	gl_Position = uMVP * aPosition;
	//why is it this way and not aPosition * uMVP?
	//order of operations for matrix multiplication 
	//openGL is right-handed 
	//input is always on the right, result is on the left. 
	//first thing that happens is on the right, and then reads leftwards.
